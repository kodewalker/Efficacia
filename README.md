Stage 1 deals with Problem 1
Optimizing the route of vehicles using genetic algorithm which uses mutations and crossovers over an initial population to come up with an optimal solution
 Random data was created with 11 cities in it. Bangalore was our starting point and the algorithm provided us with the most optimal route to cover all the remaining 10 cities
The 2 input files are cities_and_distances.csv and city_lat_lon.csv. 
Also Genetic Algo file is imported.

tsp with different modes of transport deals with Problem 3. The other files serves as input for that Jupyter notebook file.
